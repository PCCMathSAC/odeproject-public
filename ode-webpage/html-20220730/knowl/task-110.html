<div class="introduction">
<p>The basic reproduction number <span class="process-math">\(R_0\text{,}\)</span> is introduced to measure the transmission potential of a disease. It is the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infective. For example, if the <span class="process-math">\(R_0\)</span> for measles in a population is 16, then we would expect each new case of measles to produce 16 new secondary cases over the period of time during which the infected individual can actually spread the disease. The reproduction number is affected by several factors: the rate of contacts in the host population, the probability of infection being transmitted during contact, and the duration of infectiousness. In the SIR model described above,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/systems05-figure-R0.html">
\begin{equation*}
R_0 = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Simply put, <span class="process-math">\(R_0\)</span> is a metric of how contagious a disease is. It can capture three basic scenarios (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/systems05-figure-R0.html" title="Figure 2.5.2">Figure 2.5.2</a>). If <span class="process-math">\(R_0 \lt 1\text{,}\)</span> on average, an infected person infects less than one person. The disease is expected to stop spreading. If <span class="process-math">\(R_0 = 1\text{,}\)</span> an infected person infects an average of one person. The disease spread is stable, or endemic. If <span class="process-math">\(R_0 \gt 1\text{,}\)</span> on average, an infected person infects more than one person. The disease is expected to increasingly spread in the absence of intervention.  Measles is one of the most contagious with a range of 12–18 for the reproduciton number.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-32-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> Estimates of <span class="process-math">\(R_0\)</span> for COVID-19 vary in the range of 2–2.5.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-33-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a></p>
