<p>Studies on mosquito control indicate that the rate of change of the mosquito population, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> (measured in millions of mosquitoes) in the area can be accurately modeled using the following Initial Value Problem:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = kP \left( 1 - \frac{P}{M} \right) - EP, \quad P(0) = P_0,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is a constant that represents the effectiveness of insecticide spraying efforts, M is the local carrying capacity and is affected by efforts to reduce mosquito breeding grounds, <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is the population growth constant, <span class="process-math">\(P_0\)</span> is the initial population, and time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is measured in months. Current estimates suggest that there are approximately 10 million mosquitoes living near the proposed site of the hospital. Data indicates that <span class="process-math">\(M = 11\)</span> million and <span class="process-math">\(k = 1.2\)</span> for this mosquito population.</p>
