<p>We wish to find a differential equation that will model the amount of chemicals in the tailings pond at any particular time. Let <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> be the amount of chemicals in the pond at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(dx/dt\)</span> is the difference between the rate at which the chemicals are entering the pond and the rate at which the chemicals leave the pond.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dx}{dt} = \text{rate in} - \text{rate out}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since water flows into the pond from the stream at a rate of 1000 cubic meters per day, the rate at which the chemicals enter the pond is 5 kilograms per day. On the other hand, the rate at which the chemicals leave the pond will depend on the amount of chemicals in the pond at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> The volume of the pond is decreasing due to sediment, and at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> it is <span class="process-math">\(V(t) = 20000 - 50t\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the concentration of chemicals in the pond at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(x/(20000 - 50 t)\text{,}\)</span> and the rate at which the chemicals are flowing out of the pond to be recycled is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
1000 \left(  \frac{x}{20000 - 50t} \right) = \frac{20x}{ 400 - t}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Hence, the differential equation that models the amount of chemical in the tailings pond at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
\frac{dx}{dt} = 5 - \frac{20x}{ 400 - t}.\tag{1.5.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Of course, we will have to cease mining operations once the pond is full, since there will only be water in the pond if <span class="process-math">\(V(t) = 20000 - 50t \geq 0\text{;}\)</span> that is, when <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq t \lt 400\text{.}\)</span></p>
