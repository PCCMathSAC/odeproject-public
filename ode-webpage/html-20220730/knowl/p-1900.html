<p>Another flaw  in the design of the building resulted in an extreme amount of swaying. In fact, office workers in the upper stories of the building complained of motion sickness. The building actually twisted as it was swaying back and forth. Engineers determined that the building's natural sway period was dangerously close to the period of its torsion. To remedy the problem, the engineers installed a pair of tuned mass dampers on the 58th floor of the building to absorb the energy created by the swaying. This is the floor of concrete that you see near the top of the structure (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/nonlinear05-figure-john-hancock-tower.html" title="Figure 5.5.1">Figure 5.5.1</a>). In addition, 1,500 tons of steel braces were installed to keep the building from falling over in a high wind.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-48-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.5.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a></p>
