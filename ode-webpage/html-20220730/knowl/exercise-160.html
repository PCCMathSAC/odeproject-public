<p>Consider an epidemic that moves through an isolated population.  We will make the following assumptions about the epidemic.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Individuals are infected at a rate proportional to the product of the number of infected and susceptible individuals.  We assume that the constant of proportionality is <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The length of the incubation period is negligible, and infectious individuals are immediately infectious.</p></li>
<li><p>On the average, an infected individual dies after 10 days.</p></li>
<li><p>Only a single individual is initially ill.</p></li>
<li><p>Infected individuals do not give birth, but susceptible individuals have a birth rate of 0.0003 per individual per year.  Newborns are susceptible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">If <span class="process-math">\(S(t)\)</span> is the number of susceptible and <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> is the number of infected people, then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp; = -\alpha SI + 0.0003S\tag{2.2.7}\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp; = \alpha SI - 0.1I.\tag{2.2.8}
\end{align}
</div>
<p>The constant <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is a measure of the relative infectivity of the disease.  Some diseases such as Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever, are extremely infectious with a mortaility rate of up to 90%. On the other hand, AIDS which is caused by the HIV virus, has a much lower transmission rate.  The goal of this exercise is to examine the differences between the two.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(\alpha = 0.05\text{,}\)</span> draw the phase portrait.  Be sure to label all nullclines and equilibrium solutions.  Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(S(0) = 1000\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(I(0) = 1\text{.}\)</span>  What happens to the solution curve as <span class="process-math">\(t \to \infty\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
