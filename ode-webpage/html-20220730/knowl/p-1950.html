<p>If we are to use Laplace transforms to study differential equations, we would like to know which functions actually have Laplace transforms. Furthermore, if two functions have the same Laplace transform, we can ask if the functions must be the same.  In other words, we wish to know if the Laplace transform of a function exists and is unique. We can answer both of these questions affirmatively if the function <span class="process-math">\(f(t)\)</span> is piecewise continuous on <span class="process-math">\([0, \infty)\)</span> and does not grow too quickly as <span class="process-math">\(t \to \infty\text{.}\)</span> We say a function <span class="process-math">\(f(t)\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">exponentially bounded</dfn> on <span class="process-math">\([0, \infty)\)</span> if there exist constants <span class="process-math">\(M \geq 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> such that</p>
