<p>Not all populations grow exponentially; otherwise, a bacteria culture in a petri dish would grow unbounded and soon be much larger than the size of the laboratory. To see what happens if there are limiting factors to population growth, let us consider the population of fish in a children's trout pond. The number of trout will be limited by the available resources such as food supply as well as by spawning habitat. A small population of fish might grow exponentially if the pond is large and food is abundant, but the growth rate will decline as the population increases and the availability of resources declines.  We can use the <dfn class="terminology">logistic equation</dfn> to model population growth in a resource limited environment.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-8-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a></p>
