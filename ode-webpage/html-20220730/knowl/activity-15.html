<p>Consider the following predator-prey system,</p>

\begin{align*}
x' &amp; = ax(1 - x/N) - bxy\\
y' &amp; = -cy + dxy,

<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> is the population of the prey and <span class="process-math">\(y(t)\)</span> is the population of the predator at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p>How would you modify this system to include the effect of hunting of the prey at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> units of prey per unit of time?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>How would you modify this system to include the effect of hunting of the predators at a rate proportional to the number of predators?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Suppose the predators discover a second, unlimited source of food, but they still prefer to eat the primary prey when they can catch them.  How would you modify the system to include this assumption?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>Suppose the predators discover a second source of food that is limited in supply. How would you modify the system to include this assumption?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>
<p>Suppose that the predators migrate to a different area if there are more than three times as many prey as predators in that area (<span class="process-math">\(x &gt; 3y\)</span>) and they move back if there are fewer than three times as many prey as predators. How would you modify the system to take this into account?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h5>
<p>Suppose that prey move out of an area at a rate proportional to the number of predators in the area.  How would you modify the system to take this into account?</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="systems01.html#activity-15" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
