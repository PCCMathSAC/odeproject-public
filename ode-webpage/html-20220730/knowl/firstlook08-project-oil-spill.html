</h3>
<div class="introduction">
<p>Oil spills such as the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico or the Amoco Cadiz off the coast of Brittany can have disastrous consequences for society—economically, environmentally, and socially. Even smaller spills such as the Exxon Valdez can have have a huge impact on the surrounding environment due to the remoteness of the site or the difficulty of mounting an emergency environmental response.  Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water, and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up.  For this reason the timeliness of an emergency response is critical.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-17-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.8.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a></p>
<p>Suppose an oil spill occurs off the coast of Texas. From time to time, but irregularly, a helicopter is dispatched by the Coast Guard to photograph the oil slick. On each trip, the helicopter arrives over the slick, the pilot takes a photo, waits 10 minutes, takes a second photo, and heads home. On each of seven trips the size (in area) of the slick is measured from both photographs.  The data is given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/firstlook08-table-oil-spill.html" title="Table 1.8.1: Data on spread of an oil spill">Table 1.8.1</a></p>

<p>You have been retained as a consultant to the  United States Coast Guard (USCG) to analyze this data and submit a report of your findings.  Your final report should contain a one-page executive summary.  The executive summary should summarize your work in such a way that the reader can rapidly become acquainted with the material. It should contain a brief description of the problem, important background information, a discussion of pertinent assumptions, a short description of your methodology, concise analysis, and your main conclusions. Do not assume that the reader knows anything about calculus or differential equations, but does have experts that can verify your model and calculations, which should appear in an appendix.</p>
<p>Appendices should be neatly formatted and present information in a logical manner. <em class="emphasis">DO NOT</em> simply print out Sage code or a series of equations. Consolidate your results and provide a short explanation of what it is the reader is seeing while also highlighting key pieces of information in the appendix.</p>
