    <introduction>

<todo>This example is from Cliff's book.  Credit accordingly.</todo>

        <p>Let us consider an epidemic model for a city. We make the following additional assumptions about our model.
            <ul>

                <li>The city has a constant birth rate rate of <m>\alpha</m> persons per day. All new born babies are susceptible to the disease.</li>

                <li>Infected people either recover or die after a certain number of days.  If an individual recovers, he or she is immune.</li>

            </ul>
        If we let <m>S(t)</m> be the number of susceptible individuals at time <m>t</m> and <m>I(t)</m> be the number of infected individuals at time <m>t</m>, our assumptions give rise to the following system of differential equations,
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} &amp; = - \alpha SI + \beta</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} &amp; = - \gamma I + \alpha SI.</mrow>
            </md>
        The constant <m>\alpha</m> is determined by the probability of an interaction between a susceptible individual and an infected individual, and <m>\gamma</m> is the rate at which infected individuals are removed from the population. If 
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} &amp; = - \alpha SI + \beta = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} &amp; = - \gamma I + \alpha SI = 0,</mrow>
            </md>
		then both the susceptible and infected populations do not change.  This will occur at
            <md>
                <mrow>S_0 &amp; = \frac{\gamma}{\alpha}</mrow>
                <mrow>I_0 &amp; = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}.</mrow>
            </md>
		We are interested in the behavior of solutions near <m>(S_0, I_0)</m>.  If solutions approach this equilbrium point, then the disease will become endemic to the population.</p>

    	<title>Equilibrium Solutions</title>

		<p>An <term>equilibrium solution</term> for a first-order system of differential equations
            <md>
                <mrow>x'(t) &amp; = f(x, y)</mrow>
                <mrow>y'(t) &amp; = g(x, y)</mrow>
            </md>
        is a point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> such that
            <me>f(x_0, y_0) = g(x_0, y_0) = 0.</me>
        Notice that neither <m>x</m> nor <m>y</m> is changing at this point. If we have the initial conditions, <m>x(0) = x_0</m> and <m>y(0) = y_0</m>, then the solution to the system is <m>x(t) = x_0</m> and <m>y(t) = y_0</m>. Of course the interesting question is what happens if our initial conditions are close to an equilibrium solution. Do solutions tend toward the equilibrium solution, away from the equilibrium solution, or is there a combination of the two?</p>
        
        <example>
        	<p>Consider the system
	            <md>
	                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = x - 3y + xy^2</mrow>
	                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 2x - 4y - x^2y.</mrow>
	            </md>
	        From
	            <md>
	                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = x - 3y + xy^2 = 0</mrow>
	                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 2x - 4y - x^2y = 0,</mrow>
	            </md>
	        we can quickly conclude that the only equilibrium solution to the system is <m>(0, 0)</m>. The phase portrait for this system is given in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-systems05-example-1" />. If we have the initial conditions <m>x(0) = 1</m> and <m>y(0) = 1</m>, we can see that the solution tends toward the origin as <m>t \to \infty</m>. However, it is unclear from the phase portrait if the solution curves of all initial value problems with initial conditions near the origin tend towards the equilibrium solution as <m>t \to \infty</m>.</p>

			<p>Since the nonlinear terms of the system do not contribute much towards <m>dx/dt</m> and <m>dy/dt</m> for values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> near zero, we can determining the nature of the equilibrium solution by examining the system consisting of only linear terms on the right-hand side of the equation,

	                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = x - 3y</mrow>

	            </md>
	        The matrix for this linear system,
	            <me>A =
	            \begin{pmatrix}
	            1 &amp; -3 \\
	            2 &amp; -4
	            \end{pmatrix},</me>
	        has eigenvalues <m>\lambda = -1</m> and <m>\mu = -2</m> with eigenvectors <m>\mathbf u = (3,2)</m> and <m>\mathbf v = (1,1)</m>, respectively. The general solution for this linear system is
				<md>
                    <mrow>x(t) &amp; = 3 c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 e^{-2t}</mrow>
                    <mrow>y(t) &amp; = 2c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 e^{-2t}.</mrow>
                </md>
	        This indeed suggests that solutions near the origin tend towards the origin as <m>t \to \infty</m>. In this case, we say that the equilibrium solution is <term>stable</term>.</p>
	    </example>

    	<example>
    		<title>A Competing Species Model</title>
  	
	    	<p>Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be the populations of two distinct species of fish may compete for the same food in a lake. Recall from Section<nbsp /><xref ref="systems02" /> that we can model two competing species using the following system of first-order differential equations,
	            <md>
	                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = \alpha x \left(1 - \frac{x}{M} \right) - \beta xy</mrow>
	                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = \gamma y \left(1 - \frac{y}{N} \right) - \delta xy.</mrow>
	            </md>
	        The first term in each equation is the logistic growth of each species. The second term in each equation tells how each species is affected by interacting with the competing species.</p>

			<p>More specifically, let us consider the following system,
	            <mdn>
	                <mrow xml:id="equation-systems05-competing-species-1a">\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = 2x\left(1-\frac{x}{2}\right) - xy</mrow>
	                <mrow xml:id="equation-systems05-competing-species-1b">\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 3y\left(1- \frac{y}{3}\right) - 2xy.</mrow>
	            </mdn>
	        It is easy to see that  the four equilibrium solutions: <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(0,3)</m>, <m>(2,0)</m>, and <m>(1, 1)</m>.  We can view the direction field, the phase plane, and some solution curves for this system in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-systems05-competing-species" />.</p>

			<p>Let us analyze what happens at the equilibrium solution <m>(1, 1)</m>. If we decide on an appropriate change of variables, we can translate the entire system so that this equilibrium solution is at the origin. If we let

	        The idea is that the linear part is a good <term>local</term> approximation to the original equations much like a tangent line is a good local approximation to a smooth function in calculus. We can determine the local nature of the equilibrium solution by examining the eigenvalues of the matrix
	            <me>A

	        The eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are <m>\lambda = -1 + \sqrt{2} = 0.4142</m> and <m>\mu = -1 - \sqrt{2} \approx -2.4142</m> with eigenvectors <m>\mathbf u = (1,\sqrt{2}\,) \approx (1, 1.4142)</m> and <m>\mathbf v = (1,-\sqrt{2}\,)  \approx (1, -1.4142)</m>, respectively.  The solution to the linear system is now
	    		<me>\mathbf x(t) = c_1  e^{\lambda t} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} + c_2 e^{\mu t} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix}.</me>
	    	or
	    		<mdn>
	    			<mrow xml:id="equation-systems05-competing-species-4a">x(t) \amp = c_1 e^{\lambda t} + c_2 e^{\mu t}</mrow>

	    		</mdn></p>

	    	<p>If we have initial conditions <m>x(0) = 3</m> and <m>y(0) = 4</m>, one can quickly determine that <m>c_1 = 3/2 + \sqrt{2} \approx 2.9142</m> and <m>c_2 = 3/2 - \sqrt{2} \approx 0.0859</m>, and equations <nbsp /><xref ref="equation-systems05-competing-species-4a" /> and <xref ref="equation-systems05-competing-species-4b" /> become
				<mdn>
	    			<mrow xml:id="equation-systems05-competing-species-5a">x(t) \amp = 2.9142 e^{0.4142 t} + 0.0859 e^{-2.4142 t}</mrow>

	    		As <m>t \to \infty</m> notice that both <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> become very large and tend away from the origin.</p>

	    	<p>We can conclude that the equilibrium solution <m>(1,1)</m> is <term>unstable</term>. That is, tend away from the equilibrium solution as <m>t \to \infty</m> if one population begins with a slight advantage over the other. If neither popluation has an initial advantage over the other, then the solution curve will approach the equilibrium solution as <m>t \to \infty</m>.</p>

	            </md>
	        Certainly, this sytems has an equilibrium solution at <m>(0,0)</m>.  We can expand <m>\sin x</m> into a power series,

    	<title>The Epidemic Model Revisited</title>
 
 		<p>In the case of our epidemic model, 
           <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} &amp; = - \alpha SI + \beta</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} &amp; = - \gamma I + \alpha SI.</mrow>
            </md>
        we have an equilibrium solution at <m>(S, I) = (\gamma / \alpha, \beta / \gamma)</m>. It is a straightforward computation to show that the linearization of this system is given by the matrix
            <me>\begin{pmatrix}
            - \alpha\beta/\gamma &amp; -\gamma \\
            \alpha\beta/\gamma &amp; 0
            \end{pmatrix}.</me>
		The eigenvalues of this matrix are
			<me>\lambda = - \frac{\alpha\beta \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 \beta^2 - 4 \alpha \beta \gamma^2}}{2\gamma},</me>
		which we will learn to how to compute eigenvalues in Section<nbsp /><xref ref="linear01" />. The nature of the sink, of course, depends upon the eigenvalues.</p>

    <subsection>
    	<title>When Linearization Fails</title>
 
		<p>There are at least two cases when linearization does not give us the information that we seek. First, it might well be the case that the linear terms vanish in the nonlinear system.  For example, the system
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = xy</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = -x^2 + xy</mrow> 
            </md>
        has an equilibrium solution at the origin, but this linearization of this system vanishes.</p>

		<p>A more subtle example is the system
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = y - (x^2 + y^2)x</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = -x - (x^2 + y^2)y.</mrow>
            </md>
        The origin is an equilibrium solution, and the linearization of this system is
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = y</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = -x.</mrow>
            </md>
        The eigenvalue of the matrix corresponding to the linear system,
            <me>A
            =
            \begin{pmatrix}
            0 &amp; 1 \\
            -1 &amp; 0
            \end{pmatrix},</me>
        are <m>\lambda = \pm i</m>. Thus, the solution curves of the linear system are simply circles about the origin. However, the nonlinear system acts quite differently. In the nonlinear system, solutions spiral out slowly from the origin (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-systems05-linearization-fails" />). This system has no periodic solutions.</p>

			<li>We can approximate a nonlinear system
                <md>
                    <mrow>x'(t) &amp; = f(x,y)</mrow>
                    <mrow>y'(t) &amp; = g(x, y)</mrow>
                </md>
            near each equilibrium point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> with a linear system by using a Taylor series approximation for <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>. The matrix of our linear approximation,
                <me>J
                =
                \begin{pmatrix}
                f_x(x_0, y_0) &amp; f_y(x_0, y_0) \\
                g_x(x_0, y_0) &amp; g_y(x_0, y_0)
                \end{pmatrix},</me>
            is the <term>Jacobian matrix</term> of the system. We can classify nonlinear systems by examining the Jacobian matrix of the system and using the trace-determinant plane.</li>

			<li>Linearization only tells us how solutions behave near the equilibrium point. A solution curve might behave quite differently if it is far away from the equilibrium solution.</li>

			<li>In some cases, linearization can fail.</li>

			<li><p>We can use the following series of steps to summarize phase plane analysis for the nonlinear system
                <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = f(x, y)</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = g(x, y).</mrow>
                </md><ul>

    				<li><em>Step 1.</em> Draw the curves where <m>f(x, y) = 0</m>. These curves are called the <term><m>x</m>-nullclines</term>.  When a solution curve <m>{\mathbf x}(t)</m> lies on one of these curves, <m>dx/dt = 0</m>, draw vertical slash marks on the <m>x</m>-nullclines to remind yourself that a trajectory crossing the nullcline can only do so if it is moving in a vertical direction at the instant of crossing.</li>

    				<li><em>Step 2.</em> Draw the curves where <m>g(x, y) = 0</m>. These curves are called the <term><m>y</m>-nullclines</term>. When <m>{\mathbf x}(t)</m> lies on one of these curves, <m>dg/dt = 0</m>. Draw horizontal slash marks on the <m>y</m>-nullclines to remind yourself that a trajectory crossing the nullcline can only do so if it is moving in a horizontal direction at the instant of crossing.</li>

    				<li><em>Step 3.</em> Label the points where the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>-nullclines intersect. These intersections are the <term>equilibrium points</term>.  If <m>{\mathbf x}(t)</m> is ever at one of these points, then both <m>dx/dt</m> and <m>dy/dt</m> vanish.  This means that the trajectory stays at the equilibrium point for all time. If our system is going to tend towards as <term>steady state</term>, then  <m>{\mathbf x}(t)</m> will approach on of the equilibrium points as <m>t \to \infty</m>.</li>
    				
    				<li><em>Step 4.</em> Label the regions of the <m>xy</m>-plane where <m>dx/dt \lt 0</m> and where <m>dx/dy \gt 0</m>.  These regions are always separated by <m>x</m>-nullclines. Likewise, label the regions where <m>dy/dt</m> is positive and negative.</li>

    				<li><em>Step 5.</em>Go back and put arrows on the vertical hash marks of the <m>x</m> nullclines. These arrows indicate whether the motion across the null cline is up or down. The arrows are up on the parts of the <m>x</m>-nullclines that are in the <m>dy/dt \gt 0</m> region, and down on those parts of the <m>x</m>-nullclines in the <m>dy/dt \lt 0</m> regions. Likewise, draw arrows on the horizontal slash marks of the <m>y</m>-nullclines. These arrows are pointing right on the parts of the <m>y</m>-nullclines  in the <m>dx/dt \gt 0</m> regions and left point on the parts in the <m>dx/dt \lt 0</m> regions.</li>

					<li><em>Step 6.</em><ul>

							<li>If <m>dx/dt \gt 0</m> and <m>dy/dt \gt 0</m>, then both <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> are increasing and the trajectory moves up and right.</li>

							<li>If <m>dx/dt \gt 0</m> and <m>dy/dt \lt 0</m>, the trajectory moves down and right.</li>

							<li>If <m>dx/dt \lt 0</m> and <m>dy/dt \gt 0</m>, the trajectory moves up and left.</li>

							<li>If <m>dx/dt \lt 0</m> and <m>dy/dt \lt 0</m>, the trajectory moves down and left.</li>
