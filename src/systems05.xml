        <title>Mathematical Epidemiology 101</title>

        <introduction>
			<p>Systems of differential equations are very useful in epidemiology. Differential equations can be used to model various epidemics, including the bubonic plague, influenza, AIDS, the 2015 ebola outbreak in west Africa, and currently the 2020<ndash />2021 coronavirus pandemic. To understand how we might model an epidemic, we will consider a very simple situation. We will assume that we have a closed population of size <m>N</m>, where immigration, emigration, and birth do not play an important role. We will also ignore any deaths that are not related to our disease.</p>

			<p>We will assume that each individual in the population falls into one of the following categories: 
				<md>
					<mrow>S(t) \amp = \text{Susceptible individuals}</mrow>
					<mrow>I(t) \amp = \text{Infected individuals}</mrow>
					<mrow>R(t) \amp = \text{Removed individuals}</mrow>
				</md>
			Susceptible individuals are those who do not yet have the disease and can catch the disease from infected individuals. Individuals enter the removed population by either recovering from the disease or dying. If an infected individual recovers, then the individual is immune to the disease. Schematically, we can represent the effect of the disease by the diagram
				<me>S \longrightarrow I \longrightarrow R.</me>
			Since the population is closed, we know that
				<me>S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N.</me>
			This model is called an <term>SIR model</term>.</p>

			<p>We can model how the disease acts with the following system of equations,
				<md>
					<mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = - \alpha SI</mrow>
					<mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} \amp = \alpha SI - \beta I</mrow>
					<mrow>\frac{dR}{dt} \amp = \beta I.</mrow>
				</md>
			We say that <m>\alpha</m> is the rate of infection and <m>\beta</m> is the rate at which the infected are removed. That is, an infected individual either dies or recovers after <m>1/ \beta</m> days. Since
				<me>\frac{d}{dt}\left[ S(t) + I(t) + R(t)\right] = \frac{d}{dt} N = 0,</me>
			we need only solve the system
				<md>
					<mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = - \alpha SI</mrow>
					<mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} \amp = \alpha SI - \beta I.</mrow>
				</md>
			This is a nonlinear system, but it can be solved numerically.</p>
