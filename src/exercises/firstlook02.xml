            <p><em>Homogeneous Equations</em>. A first-order differential equation, <m>y' = f(x, y)</m>, is <em>homogeneous</em> if <m>f(x, y) = f(tx, ty)</m>.
                <ol>

                    <li>Show that the equation
                        <me>\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2xy}</me>
                    is homogeneous.</li>

                    <li>Let <m>y = xv</m> and show that the equation in part (a) can be written as
                        <me>v + x\frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{x^2 + v^2 x^2}{2v x^2}.</me>
                    Use the fact that this new equation is separable to solve for <m>y</m>.</li>

                    <li>Show that any homogeneous equation <m>y' = f(x, y)</m> can be transformed into a separable differential equation by making the substitution <m>y = vx</m>.</li>

                    <li>A function <m>f</m> is said to homogeneous of degree <m>n</m> if <m>f(t x, t y)= t^n f(x, y)</m> for <m>n = 1, 2, \ldots</m>.  Show that differential equation
                        <me>P(x, y) dx + Q(x, y) dy = 0,</me>
                    where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are both homogeneous of degree <m>n</m>, 
                    can be transformed into a separable differential equation using the substitution <m>y = vx</m>.</li>

                    <li>Solve the differential equation
                        <me>x^2 y' = 2 y^2 - x^2.</me></li>

        <statement>
            <p>Mr. Ratchett, an elderly American, was found murdered in his train compartment on the Orient Express at 7 A.M.  When his body was discovered, the famous detective Hercule Poirot noted that Ratchett had a body temperature of 28 degress. The body had cooled to a temperture of 27 degrees one hour later.  If the normal temperature of a human being is 37 degrees and the air temperature in the train is 22 degrees, estimate the time of Ratchett's death using Newton's Law of Cooling.</p>
