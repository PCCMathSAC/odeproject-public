		<statement>
			<p><ol>
			
				<li>Suppose that an opera singer can break a glass by singing a particular note.  Will the singer have to sing a higher note or a lower note to break an identical glass that is half full of water?</li>
				
				<li>Suppose that both notes are within the opera singer's range.  Will it be harder or easier to break the glass when it is half full of water?</li>
				
				<li>Commercials for a maker of recording tape show a crystal glass being broken by the sound of a recording of an opera singer's voice.  Is this a good test of the quality of the tape?  Why or why not?</li>

		<statement>
			<p>For large <m>t</m>, every solution of 
				<me>y'' + py' + qy = \cos \omega t</me>
			oscillates with angular frequency <m>\omega</m> and amplitude <m>A</m> given by
				<me>A( \omega, p, q) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(q - \omega^2)^2 + p^2 \omega^2}}.</me>
			That is, the amplitude of <m>A</m> is a function of the parameters <m>\omega</m>, <m>p</m>, and <m>q</m>.
				<ol>

					<li>Compute <m>\dfrac{\partial A}{\partial \omega}</m>.</li>
					
					<li>For fixed <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>, let <m>M(p, q)</m> denote the maximum value of <m>A( \omega, p, q)</m> as a function of <m>\omega</m>.  Compute an expression for <m>M(p, q)</m>.</li>
					
					<li>Set <m>q = 1</m> and plot <m>M(p, q)</m> as a function of <m>p</m>.</li>
					
					<li>Explain why <m>M(p, q)</m> is proportional to <m>1/p</m> as <m>p \to 0</m>.</li>

	<exercise>
		<statement>
			<p>Let us examine the amplitude and phase of the steady-state solution,
	            <me>x_p(t) = G(\omega) A \cos(\omega t - \phi),</me>
	        where
	            <me>G(\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + 4 c^2 \omega^2}}.</me>
	        Now let <m>s = \omega / \omega_0</m> and <m>D = 2c/\omega_0</m>.  These new constants, <m>s</m> and <m>D</m>, measure the ratio of the driving frequency to the natural frequency and the effect of the damping force, respectively.  Thus,
	            <me>G = \frac{1}{\omega_0^2\sqrt{(1- s^2)^2 + D^2 s^2}}</me>
	        or
	            <me>\omega_0^2G = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1- s^2)^2 + D^2 s^2}}.</me>
	        This expression shows us how the gain varies as <m>s = \omega/\omega_0</m> varies.  The natural frequency is fixed in
	            <me>x'' + 2c x' + \omega_0^2 x = A \cos \omega t</me>
	        and <m>D = 2c/\omega_0</m> is proportional to the damping constant.</p>
