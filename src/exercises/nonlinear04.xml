	<exercise>
		<statement>
			<p>Suppose that the smell of a bunch of dead fish in the region <m>-2 \leq x \leq 2</m>, <m>-2 \leq y \leq 2</m> is given by the function
				<me>S(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - \frac{x^4 + y^4}{4} - 3x^2 y^2 + 100.</me>
				<ol>

					<li>What is the gradient system who vector field is the gradient of <m>S</m>?</li>

					<li>Use Sage to graph the  phase portrait of the system.</li>

					<li>How many dead fish are there and where are they?</li>
