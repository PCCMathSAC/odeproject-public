        <statement>
            <p>Find all of the equilibrium solutions for each of the following differential equations.  Use Sage to graph the direction field of each equation and then superimpose a plot of the equilibrium solution(s) on the direction field. Classify each equilibrium solution as a sink, a source, or a node.
                <ol>

                    <li><m>y' = 2y(1 - y)</m></li>

                    <li><m>\dfrac{dP}{dt} = 0.1P(P - 100)</m></li>

                    <li><m>\dfrac{dx}{dt} = (2 - x)\cos x</m></li>

                    <li><m>\dfrac{dy}{dx} = (2 - y)\cos x</m></li>
