    <exercise>
        <statement>
            <p>Consider the system
                <md>
                    <mrow>x' &amp; = 2x</mrow>
                    <mrow>y' &amp; = y</mrow>
                </md>
            with initial conditions <m>x(0) = 1</m> and <m>y(0) = 3</m>.<fn>You will find Sage very useful for this exercise</fn>
                <ol>

                <li>Show that <m>{\mathbf x}(t) = (e^{2t}, 3e^t)</m> satisfies the initial value problem.</li>

                <li>Use Euler's method with step size <m>\Delta t = 0.5</m> to approximate this solution, and check how close the approximation is to the real solution when <m>t = 2</m>, <m>t = 4</m>, and <m>t = 6</m>.</li>

                <li>Use Euler's method with step size <m>\Delta t = 0.1</m> to approximate this solution, and check how close the approximation is to the real solution when <m>t = 2</m>, <m>t = 4</m>, and <m>t = 6</m>.</li>

                <li>Discuss how and why the Euler approximations differ from the real solution.</li>
