    <title>The Lorenz Equations</title>
    
    <subsection>
    	<title>The Lorenz Equations</title>

        <p>In 1963, an MIT professor, Edward N. Lorenz, published a paper on his research in meteorology.  Using differential equations, Lorenz had developed a simplified system to model certain weather-related phenomena.  When he analyzed the system, however, he found that the trajectories of the solutions were incredibly convoluted and effectively unpredictable for certain parameters. The <term>Lorenz equations</term> can be written as 
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = -\sigma x + \sigma y</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = \rho x - y - xz</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{dz}{dt} &amp; = -\beta z + xy,</mrow>
			</md>
		where <m>\sigma</m>, <m>\rho</m>, and <m>\beta</m> are constants.  The Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for systems of differential equations guarantees a unique solution for each set of initial conditions, 
			<md>
				<mrow>x(0) &amp; = x_0</mrow>
				<mrow>y(0) &amp; = y_0</mrow>
				<mrow>z(0) &amp; = z_0.</mrow>
			</md>
		However, Lorenz discovered that the trajectories of the solutions were incredibly convoluted and effectively unpredictable  for certain parameters.    For certain values of <m>\sigma</m>, <m>\rho</m>, and <m>\beta</m>, the trajectories are  extremely sensitive to initial conditions.  Since real data always has some inherent uncertainty, initial values are never precisely known, and we may have little success  modeling real world phenomena.  In addition, solutions can stay in a bounded region of the three dimensional version of the phase plane and wind through the region along an incredibly convoluted path.  There is much more freedom to move around in three dimensions than there is in two.</p>

    	<title>Lorenz's Example</title>

		<p>Lorenz noticed that the system behaved strangely, when he let <m>\sigma =10</m>, <m>\rho = 28</m>, and <m>\beta = 8/3</m>.  Thus, our system 
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = -10 x + 10 y</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 28 x - y - xz</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{dz}{dt} &amp; = -\frac{8}{3} z + xy,</mrow>
			</md>
		defines a vector field in <m>{\mathbb R}^3</m>,
			<me>{\mathbf F}(x, y, z) 
			=
			\left(
			-10 x + 10 y,
			28 x - y - xz,
			-\frac{8}{3} z + xy
			\right),</me>
		and the equilibrium solutions occur exactly when this vector field is zero.  That is, <m>(x,y,z)</m> is an equilibrium solution if
			<me>{\mathbf F}(x, y, z) 
			=
			\left(
			-10 x + 10 y,
			28 x - y - xz,
			-\frac{8}{3} z + xy
			\right)
			=
			(0, 0, 0).</me>
		It is easy to check that <m>(0, 0, 0)</m>, <m>(6\sqrt{2}, 6\sqrt{2}, 27)</m>, and <m>(-6\sqrt{2}, -6\sqrt{2}, 27)</m> are the equilibrium solutions to the Lorenz system for the parameters that we have chosen.  With the exception of these equilibrium solutions it is probably impossible to find solutions for the system, so we will have to use a numerical algorithm to approximate solutions (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-nonlinear06-lorenz-1" />).</p>

    <subsection>
    	<title>The Equilibrium Solutions</title>

		<p>If we wish to understand the nature of the equilibrium solutions of the Lorenz system, it makes sense to linearize the system.  The Jacobian matrix of the Lorenz system is
			<me>J(x, y, z)
			=
			\begin{pmatrix}
			-10 &amp; 10 &amp; 0 \\
			28 - z &amp; -1 &amp; -x \\
			y &amp; x &amp; -8/3
			\end{pmatrix}.</me>
		At the origin, the Jacobian is
			<me>J
			=
			\begin{pmatrix}
			-10 &amp; 10 &amp; 0 \\
			28 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
			0 &amp; 0 &amp; -8/3
			\end{pmatrix}.</me>
		Thus, the linear system that approximates the Lorenz system at the origin is
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = - 10x + 10 y</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 28x - y</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{dz}{dt} &amp; = -\frac{8}{3} z.</mrow>
			</md>
		This system decouples into two systems,
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = - 10x + 10 y</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 28x - y,</mrow>
			</md>
		and 
			<me>\frac{dz}{dt} = -\frac{8}{3} z.</me>
		Consequently, the origin is a sink in the <m>z</m>-direction and a saddle in the <m>xy</m>-plane.</p>

		<p>Now let us consider what happens at the other two equilibrium solutions.  For the equilibrium point <m>(6\sqrt{2}, 6\sqrt{2}, 27)</m>, we have the Jacobian matrix
			<me>J 
			=
			\begin{pmatrix}
			-10 &amp; 10 &amp; 0 \\
			1 &amp; -1 &amp; -6 \sqrt{2} \\
			6 \sqrt{2} &amp; 6\sqrt{2} &amp; - 8/3
			\end{pmatrix}.</me>
		The eigenvalues of this matrix are
			<md>
				<mrow>\lambda_1 &amp; \approx -13.8</mrow>
				<mrow>\lambda_2 &amp; \approx 0.094 + 10.2i</mrow>
				<mrow>\lambda_3 &amp; \approx 0.094 - 10.2i.</mrow>
			</md>
		Therefore, this equilibrium point is a spiral saddle that has a line of solutions that tend toward the equilibrium point as <m>t</m> increases and a plane of solutions that spiral towards the equilibrium point as <m>t</m> decreases.  That is, solutions approach this equilibrium point along the direction of the eigenvalue of the negative eigenvector, then spiral slowly away along the plane corresponding  to the complex eigenvalues.  Similarly, the equilibrium solution <m>(-6\sqrt{2}, -6\sqrt{2}, 27)</m> is a spiral saddle.</p>

    <subsection>
    	<title>Solution Behavior</title>

		<p>Now that we have some idea of how the solutions of the Lorenz system behave near the equilibrium solutions, we can start to understand global behavior of the system.  A trajectory approaches one of the two equilibrium solutions <m>(\pm 6\sqrt{2}, \pm 6\sqrt{2}, 27)</m> along the straight line corresponding to the negative eigenvalue.  When the trajectory gets close enough to the equilibrium solutions, it begins to spiral away.  When the spiral is large enough, the trajectory come under the influence of the saddle at the origin and either returns to repeat it previous pattern or moves over to the other equilibrium solution (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-nonlinear06-lorenz-2" />).</p>
