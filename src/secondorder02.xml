    <introduction>

        <p>Harmonic oscillators such as a spring-mass system (Subsection<nbsp /><xref ref="subsection-firstlook01-spring-mass" />) or an RLC circuit (Section<nbsp /><xref ref="secondorder01" />) can be modeled with second-order linear differential equations. Indeed, we can model a spring-mass system with the equation
            <me>mx''(t) + b x'(t) +k x(t) = g(t),</me> 
        where <m>m</m> is the mass, <m>b</m> is the damping coefficient, <m>k</m> is the spring constant, and <m>F(t) = g(t)</m> represents some external force applied to our system. RLC circuits can also be modeled with provide another example of forcing. If <m>I(t)</m> is the rate at which a charge flows through a circuit (measured in amperes or amps), <m>R</m> is the resistance (measured in ohms), <m>C</m> is the capacitance (measured in farads), and the inductance, <m>L</m>, is (measured in henrys), then the derivative of the impressed voltage (measured in volts), <m>E(t)</m>, is the forcing term
            <me>L I'' + RI' + \frac{1}{C} I = E'(t).</me>
        What is different about these two equations are the terms on the righthand side, <m>g(t)</m> and <m>E'(t)</m>. Such a term is called a <term>forcing term</term>.</p>

        <title>Nonhomogeneous Equations</title>

		<p>A <term>nonhomogeneous second-order linear differential equation</term> is an equation of the form
            <me>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = g(t).</me>
        We have already seen how examples of such equations arise when examining models of harmonic oscillators with forcing terms. Our goal is to be able to solve such equations. In general, these equations can be difficult to solve for an arbitrary function <m>g(t)</m>. Before we attempt to find solutions for some of the more common functions that might occur for <m>g(t)</m>, let us derive some fundamental facts about second-order linear differential equations.</p>

        <theorem xml:id="theorem-secondorder02-nonhomogeneous-difference">
            <statement>
                <p>Suppose that

                has solutions <m>x_1 = x_1(t)</m> and <m>x_2 = x_2(t)</m>.  Then <m>x_1(t) - x_2(t)</m> is a solution of the homogeneous linear differential equation

            </statement>
        </theorem> 
		
		<proof>
            <p>Since <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are solutions of <xref ref="equation-secondorder02-nonhomogeneous-difference" />, we know that 
                <md>

            Thus,

		</proof>
		
	
		<p>We can use Theorem <xref ref="theorem-secondorder02-nonhomogeneous-difference" /> to derive the fact that the general solution to
            <men xml:id="equation-secondorder02-nonhomogeneous">x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = g(t).</men>
        can be written in the form
            <me>x = x_h + x_p,</me>
        where <m>y_h</m> is the general solution of the homogeneous equation
            <me>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = 0,</me>
        and <m>x_p</m> is any solution of <xref ref="equation-secondorder02-nonhomogeneous" />. Indeed, suppose that <m>x_q</m> is another solution to <xref ref="equation-secondorder02-nonhomogeneous" />. Then <m>x_q - x_p</m> is a solution to the homogeneous equation
            <me>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = 0.</me>
        Therefore,
            <me>x_q - x_p =x_h</me>
        or
            <me>x_q =x_h + x_p.</me>
        We state this fact in the following theorem.</p>

        <theorem xml:id="theorem-secondorder02-nonhomogeneous-general-solution">

                <p>Let <m>x_p</m> be a particular solution of the equation

                    <me>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = 0.</me>
                Then the general solution to <m>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = g(t)</m> is <m>x = x_h + x_p</m>.</p>

    	<title>Forcing Terms</title>
    	
    	<p>The equation 
            <me>m x'' + bx' + kx = g(t)</me>
        can be used to model a harmonic oscillator where forcing occurs. In general, we will not be able to solve this equation explicitly for a given <m>g(t)</m>; however, certain forcing functions often occur in practice. Some of the more important forcing functions are <m>g(t) = e^{-at}</m>, where the external force decreases exponentially over time; <m>g(t) = k</m>, where a constant force is applied; and <m>g(t) = \cos \omega t</m> or <m>g(t) = \sin \omega t</m>, where a force is applied periodically.</p>

		<p>In the case of the unforced damped harmonic oscillator, 
            <me>m x'' + b x' + kx =0,</me>
        we know that <m>m \gt 0</m>, <m>b \gt 0</m>, and <m>k \gt 0</m>. Thus, we can rewrite this equation as
            <me>x'' + px' + q x = 0,</me>
        where <m>p = b/m</m> and <m>q = k/m</m> are both positive. As a first-order linear system, the harmonic oscillator is

                <mrow>y' &amp; = - qx -py.</mrow>
            </md>
        The matrix corresponding to this system,
            <me>A
            =
            \begin{pmatrix}

            \end{pmatrix},</me>
        has trace of <m>-p</m> and determinant <m>q</m>. Since <m>\trace(A) \lt 0</m> and <m>\det(A) \gt 0</m>, we know that any solution of the unforced equation tends toward the origin as <m>t \to \infty</m>. That is, the solution is a sink. This leads us to the following conclusion.</p>

        <theorem xml:id="theorem-secondorder02-steady-state">
            <statement>
                <p>Suppose

                has solution <m>x = x_h + x_p</m>, where <m>p \gt 0</m> and <m>q \gt 0</m>.  If 
                    <me>x = x_h + x_p</me>
                is the general solution to the equation, then
                    <me>x = x_h + x_p \to x_p</me>
                as <m>t \to \infty</m>.</p>
            </statement>
        </theorem> 
        
        <p>In other words, all solutions of a damped harmonic oscillator with nonzero damping are essentially the same for large values of <m>t</m>.</p>

            a harmonic oscillator with a constant forcing function. It is easy to check that the general solution to the homogeneous equation

        <example>
    		<p>Now let us consider a more complicated example. Suppose that we wish to solve
                <men xml:id="equation-secondorder02-exponential-forcing-1">x'' + 5x' + 4x = e^{-2t}.</men>
            This is the equation of a harmonic oscillator with a forcing function that decreases exponentially with time. We already know the solution to the homogeneous equation. We will use the <term>method of undetermined coefficients</term> to find a particular solution to <xref ref="equation-secondorder02-exponential-forcing-1" />. It is reasonable to guess that a particular solution will have the form
                <me>x_p = Ae^{-2t}.</me>
            Substituting this expression into <xref ref="equation-secondorder02-exponential-forcing-1" />, we find that
                <me>e^{-2t}= x_p'' + 5 x_p' + 4x_p = 4 A e^{-2t} - 10 A e^{-2t}  + 4 Ae^{-2t} = -2 A e^{-2t}.</me>
            Hence, <m>A = -1/2</m>. Therefore, the solution that we seek is

    		<p>Now let us examine what happens if we have a periodic forcing function. Let us assume that the particular solution to the equation

            takes the form

    		<p>As a final example, consider the 
                <me>x'' + 5x' + 4x = e^{-t}.</me>
            Recall that the solution to the homogeneous equation <m>x'' + 5x' + 4x = 0</m> is
                <me>x_h = c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 e^{-4t}.</me>
            Our guess of <m>x_p(t) = A e^{-t}</m> for a particular solution will no longer work since <m>e^{-t}</m> is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We must therefore consider a function of a different form. Such a function must yield a multiple of <m>e^{-t}</m> when differentiated. The simplest such function is of the form
                <me>x_p = A t e^{-t}.</me>
            Using this guess,
                <md>
                    <mrow>e^{-t} &amp; = \frac{d^2}{dt^2} Ate^{-t} + 5 \frac{d}{dt} Ate^{-t} + 4A te^{-t}</mrow>

            Thus, <m>A = 1/3</m> and our general solution is

			<li>A <term>nonhomogeneous second-order linear differential equation</term> is an equation of the form
                <me>x'' + p(t) x' + q(t) x = g(t).</me>
            Forced harmonic oscillators and RLC circuits provide good examples of nonhomogeneous second-order linear differential equations.</li>

			<li>Suppose that 
                <me>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = g(t)</me>
            has solutions <m>x_1 = x_1(t)</m> and <m>x_2 = x_2(t)</m>.  Then <m>x_1(t) - x_2(t)</m> is a solution of the homogeneous linear differential equation
                <me>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = 0.</me></li>

			<li>Let <m>x_p</m> be a particular solution of the equation
                <me>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = g(t),</me>
            and <m>x_h</m> be the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation
                <me>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = 0.</me>
            Then the general solution to <m>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = g(t)</m> is <m>x = x_h + x_p</m>. In particular, if the solution to <m> x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = 0</m> has a sink at the origin, all solutions of the equation <m>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = g(t)</m> approach <m>x_p(t)</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>.</li>

			<li>The Method of Undetermined Coefficients is useful for solving the equation <m>x'' +p(t) x' + q(t) x = g(t)</m>, when <m>g</m> is of the form
                <me>g(t) =
                P_n(t) e^{\alpha t} \left\{\begin{array}{c}
                \sin \beta t \\
                \cos \beta t
                \end{array}\right.</me></li>
