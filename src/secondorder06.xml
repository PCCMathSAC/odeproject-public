		<title>The History of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge</title>

        <p>Construction on first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, A.K.A. <q>Galloping Gertie</q>, was completed on July 1, 1940, the bridge was opened to traffic (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-secondorder06-tacoma-narrows-bridge" />).  Even on the first day of operation, people driving bridge experienced vertical oscillations of several feet.  On the morning of November 7, these vertical oscillations were as large as three feet.  Later that morning, the bridge began to experience torsional oscillations as great as 23 degrees.  The bridge failed castrophically at 11:10 a.m. with the center span falling into Puget Sound below.</p>

        <p>There are many interesting stories connected with the first Tacoma Narrows bridge.  One of the insurance policies had been written by a local travel agent who pocketed the premium and failed to report the <dollar />800,000 policy to his company.  During sentencing at his trial, he pointed out that bridge officials had planned to cancel all policies in one more week after which his crime would have never been discovered..  After the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge, the governor of the State of Washington announced, <q>We are going to build the exact same bridge, exactly as before.</q>  Theodore Von Kármán, director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the board of inquiry into the collapse,<fn>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, managed by the California Institute of Technology for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration grew out of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory.</fn> sent a telegram to the governor stating, <q>If you build the exact same bridge exactly as before, it will fall into the exact same river exactly as before.</q></p>

        <title>The Design of the Narrows Bridge</title>

		<p>The Tacoma Narrows bridge is a suspension bridge like the Golden Gate bridge.  The road bed of the suspension bridge was hung from vertical cables attached to other cables strung between the two towers.  If we think of the cables as long springs, it is tempting to model the oscillations of the road bed with an harmonic oscillator, and one's first guess as to the reason for the collapse of the bridge would be resonance.</p>

		<p>However, the answer may not be so simple.  If the collapse of the bridge was due to resonance, the forcing frequency of a forced harmonic oscillator must be close to its natural frequency, but the wind (the forcing) simply does not behave like this.  One explanation might be the fact that cables are not true springs.  They act more like rubber bands.  Imagine a mass suspended by both a spring and a rubber band.  The rubber band acts like a spring when it is stretched, but there is no restoring force if the oscillator is in a compressed position (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-secondorder06-spring-rubber-band" />).<fn>For the arguments for and against resonance, consult the references at the end of this section.</fn></p>

    <subsection>
        <title>The Spring-Rubber Band Model</title>

		<p>Suppose that <m>y(t)</m> is vertical displacement of the mass the spring-rubber band model (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-secondorder06-spring-rubber-band" />), where the displacement is positive in the downward direction and negative in the upward direction.  We will also assume that we have a damped system.  If this is the case, we can model the motion of the mass with the differential equation 
			<men xml:id="equation-secondorder06-spring-rubber-band-1">my'' = - b y' - k_1 y -  k_2 y^+ + F(t),</men>
		where <m>y^+ = \max(y, 0)</m>.  Here,  <m>m</m> is the mass, <m>b</m> is the damping coefficient, <m>k_1</m> is the spring constant, and <m>F(t)</m> is the forcing term.  The term <m>k_2 y^+</m> corresponds to the rubber band in our system and can be explained as follows:
			<me>y^+(t) =
			\begin{cases}
			y(t), &amp; \text{the rubber band is stretched}, \\
			0,    &amp; \text{the rubber band is slack or tight but not stretched}.
			\end{cases}</me>
		Thus, the rubber band acts as a spring with spring coefficient <m>k_2</m>, if the rubber band is stretched, but has no effect on the system if the rubber band is slack. Of course, the term <m>my''</m> is just an application of Newton's Second law of Motion.</p>

		<p>We can rewrite equation<nbsp /><xref ref="equation-secondorder06-spring-rubber-band-1" /> in the more familiar form
			<men xml:id="equation-secondorder06-spring-rubber-band-2">my'' + b y' + k_1 y +  k_2 y^+ = F(t),</men>		
		Our first observation is that this equation is a nonlinear due to the <m>y^+</m> term.  This may effect how sensitive the system is to initial conditions.  A linear harmonic oscillator is not sensitive to initial conditions.  For example, suppose we consider the harmonic oscillator
			<me>y'' + 2 y' + 2y = \sin t</me>
		and examine the behavior of the solutions for different initial conditions.  In Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-secondorder06-tacoma-solutions-1" />, we give the solutions for <m>y(0) = 0</m> with <m>y'(0) = -4</m>, <m>y'(0) = 1</m>, and <m>y'(0) = 3</m>.  Even though the transient part of the solution can differ a great deal depending on the initial conditions, all of the solutions eventually approach the steady-state solution.</p>

            <image width="350" source="images/tacoma-solutions-1.png" />
        </figure>

		<p>Let us return to our spring-rubber band model and let us assume that <m>m = 1</m>. We can rewrite equation<nbsp /><xref ref="equation-secondorder06-spring-rubber-band-2" /> as a system of first-order equations,
			<md>
				<mrow>y' &amp; = v</mrow>
				<mrow>v' &amp; = - k_1 y  - k_2 y^+ - b v + F(t)</mrow>
			</md>
		or
			<md>
				<mrow>x' &amp; = v</mrow>
				<mrow>v' &amp; = - h(y) -  b v + F(t),</mrow>
			</md>
		where
			<me>h(y)
			=
			\begin{cases}
			k_1 y &amp; \text{if } y \lt 0 \\
			(k_1 + k_2) y &amp; \text{if } y \geq 0.
			\end{cases}</me>
		Let us assume that the forcing term is <m>F(t) = 10 + \lambda \sin \mu t</m>.  If we keep <m>\lambda</m> small and assume that both <m>y(0)</m> and <m>y'(0)</m> are small, there will always be tension on the rubber band.  Or in the case of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, there will always be tension on the cables of the suspension bridge. However, a large initial velocity such as a gust of wind on the bridge, might cause the cables to go slack.</p>

		<p>To see how this works in practice, we choose constants <m>\lambda = 0.1</m>, <m>\mu = 4</m>, <m>k_1 = 13</m>, <m>k_2 = 4</m>, and <m>b = 0.01</m>, the system becomes
			<md>
				<mrow>y' &amp; = v</mrow>
				<mrow>v' &amp; = - h(y) -  0.01v + 10 + 4 \sin 0.1 t</mrow>
			</md>
		where
			<me>h(y)
			=
			\begin{cases}
			13 x &amp; \text{if } x \lt 0 \\
			17 x &amp; \text{if } x \geq 0.
			\end{cases}</me>
		This is a nonautonomous (and nonlinear) system and can be very sensitive to initial conditions.  If we find a numerical solution to this system with <m>y(0) = 0</m> and <m>v(0) = 4.764</m>, we obtain low amplitude solutions (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-secondorder06-tacoma-solutions-2" />).  However, we only have to change the initial velocity of the system slightly to <m>v(0) = 4.765</m> in order to obtain large amplitude solutions that do not die out over time.</p>

    	<title>The Bridge Model</title>

		<p>We can now model the bridge by 
			<me>m y'' + \alpha y' + \beta y + \gamma y^+ = -gm + F(t),</me>
		where
			<ul>

				<li><m>y</m> is the height of the road bed at the center of the bridge.</li>

				<li><m>m</m> is the mass of the bridge.</li>

				<li><m>\alpha y'</m> is the damping term.  We assume that <m>\alpha</m> is small since suspension bridges are relatively flexible structures.</li>

				<li><m>\beta y</m> is the force provided by the material of the bridge pulling the bridge back to <m>y = 0</m>.</li>

				<li><m>\gamma y^+</m> is the force provided by the pull of the cables.</li>

				<li><m>-gm</m> is the force provided by gravity.</li>

				<li><m>F(t)</m> is the periodic force provided by the wind.  Yes, wind does provide a periodic force.  Just think of how a flag flutters in a wind.</li>

    	<title>The Model for Torsion</title>

		<p>We have still not accounted for the large torsional oscillations that occurred on November 7, 1940, the day that the Tacoma Narrows bridge collapsed.  If we look down the bridge (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-secondorder06-tacoma-narrows-bridge" />), we see the road bed suspended from two cables<mdash />one on each side of the road.  Thus, we can view a cross-section of the bridge as a rod suspended by cables or springs on each end.  The bar is free to move vertically and rotate about its center of mass.</p>

		<p>If a spring with spring constant <m>k</m> is extended by a distance <m>y</m>, the potential energy is <m>ky^2/2</m>.  Let <m>\theta</m> be the angle of the rod from the horizontal.  If a rod of mass <m>m</m> and length <m>2l</m> rotates about its center of gravity with angular velocity <m>d\theta/dt</m>, then its kinetic energy is given by<fn>Consult your local physicist.</fn>
			<me>\frac{1}{6} m l^2 \left(  \frac{d \theta}{dt} \right)^2.</me>
		The potential due to gravity is <m>-mgy</m>.</p>

		<p>The extension of one spring is given by <m>(y - l \sin \theta)^+</m> and  <m>(y + l \sin \theta)^+</m> in the other, where <m>y^+ = \max(y,0)</m>.  We are making the assumption that the cables remain vertical. Since the cables are relatively long compared to the length of the roadbed, this is a reasonable assumption.</p>

		<p>The total potential energy is given by
			<me>V = \left(\frac{k}{2}\right) \left( \left( (y - l \sin \theta)^+\right)^2 + (y + l \sin \theta)^+ \right)^2 - mgy,</me>
		and the total kinetic energy is given by
			<me>T = \frac{m}{2}   \left(  \frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{6} m l^2 \left(  \frac{d \theta}{dt} \right)^2.</me>
		Let <m>L = T - V</m> and put 
			<me>\frac{d}{dt} \left(  \frac{\delta L}{\delta \theta'} \right) = \frac{\delta L}{\delta \theta}</me>
		and
			<me>\frac{d}{dt} \left(  \frac{\delta L}{\delta y'} \right) = \frac{\delta L}{\delta y}</me>
		where <m>\delta \theta'</m> and <m>\delta y'</m> are small damping terms.  Thus, we obtain the equations
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{1}{3} m l^2 \theta'' &amp; = k l \cos \theta [(y - l \sin \theta)^+ - (y + l \sin \theta)^+]</mrow>
				<mrow>y'' &amp; = -k [(y - l \sin \theta)^+ + (y + l \sin \theta)^+] + mg</mrow>
			</md>
		Since the force exerted by the springs (cables) is not perpendicular to the rod but at an angle <m>\theta</m>, <m>\cos \theta</m> must appear in the first equation.  Adding forcing and damping terms,  we have
			<md>
				<mrow>\theta'' &amp; = - \delta \theta'  + \frac{3k}{ml}\cos \theta [(y - l \sin \theta)^+ - (y + l \sin \theta)^+]  + F(t)</mrow>
				<mrow>y'' &amp; = - \delta y' - \frac{k}{m}[(y - l \sin \theta)^+ + (y + l \sin \theta)^+] + g.</mrow>
			</md></p>

		<p>If we assume that the cables never lose tension, then
			<md>
				<mrow>(y - l \sin \theta)^+ &amp; = y - l \sin \theta</mrow>
				<mrow>(y + l \sin \theta)^+ &amp; = y + l \sin \theta</mrow>
			</md>
		and we end up with the uncoupled equations
			<md>
				<mrow>\theta'' &amp; = - \delta \theta'  - \frac{6k}{m}\cos \theta \sin \theta + F(t)</mrow>
				<mrow>y'' &amp; = - \delta y' - \frac{2k}{m} y + g.</mrow>
			</md>
		The first equation models the torsional motion while the second models the vertical motion.</p>

		<p>If the torsional oscillations are very small, then we can assume that
			<me>\sin \theta \approx \theta \qquad \text{and} \qquad \cos \theta \approx 1,</me>
		or
			<md>
				<mrow>\theta'' &amp; = - \delta \theta'  - \frac{6k}{m}\theta + F(t)</mrow>
				<mrow>y'' &amp; = - \delta y' - \frac{2k}{m} y + g,</mrow>
			</md>
		each of which is which is linear.  However, the torsional oscillations for the Narrow bridge were as large as 23 degrees.  The linear model
			<me>\theta'' = - 0.01 \theta'  - (2.4) \theta + (1.2) \sin(0.06 t)</me>
		and the nonlinear model
			<me>\theta'' = - 0.01 \theta'  - (2.4) \cos \theta \sin \theta + (1.2) \sin(0.06 t)</me>
		behave very differently under the initial conditions <m>\theta(0) = 1.2</m> and <m>\theta'(0) = 0</m>.  See Figures<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-secondorder06-tacoma-linear-torsion" /> and <xref ref="figure-secondorder06-tacoma-nonlinear-torsion" /></p>

        <title>Important Lessons</title>

		<p><ul>
		
			<li>Our model of the collapse of the Narrows bridge is a very simplified model.  Actually, the bridge oscillated in two sections before its collapse.  To model this phenomenon, we would have to use a partial differential equation.  Still, our model does show that a small change in initial conditions can mean a pronounced change in how the system behaves.</li>
